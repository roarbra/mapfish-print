<h4 id="cli">Command Line Distribution <a class="headerlink" href="#cli" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>
    The Zip file and the Tar file are Mapfish Print distributed as an application that can be ran from the commandline to
    execute print jobs. It is useful for debugging print configurations and requests.
</p>
<p>
    Assuming you have Java 7+ installed, the <code>bin/print</code> script will execute a print task.  The command line useage can be
    printed by executing: <code>bin/print -?</code>.
</p>
<p>
    An example of using the application is: <code>bin/print -config config.yaml -spec requestData.json -output out.pdf</code>
</p>

<h4>Example configuration</h4>
<p>A number of example configurations and requests can be found in the Github repository:
<a href="https://github.com/mapfish/mapfish-print/tree/master/examples/src/test/resources/examples">MapFish Print example</a>.

These examples are also used as continuous integration test.

<h4 id="war">Web Application (WAR) Distribution <a class="headerlink" href="#war" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>
    The Mapfish Print WAR file
    is a Java archive that can be ran in any Java Web Application Server like
    <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_blank">Tomcat</a> or <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_blank">Jetty</a>.  To
    use Mapfish Print as a standalone Web Application you should:
    <ul>
        <li>Install Java 7 or later</li>
        <li>Download a Web Application Server</li>
        <li>Put the Mapfish print WAR file in the webapps directory of the Web Application Server</li>
        <li>Rename the Mapfish Print WAR file to a more convenient name like print.war (the name will be part of the url)</li>
        <li>Start the Web Application Server</li>
        <li>
            Verify the application is executed correctly by visiting http://localhost:8080/print/index.html.
            (This assumes that the server is running on localhost port 8080 and you renamed the war to print.war)
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4 id="jar">Java Library Distribution <a class="headerlink" href="#jar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>
    The JAR file contains
    the Mapfish Print code for integrating Mapfish Print into an existing application.  It is only the java code
    with none of the dependent class files, so all dependencies will also need to be downloaded.
